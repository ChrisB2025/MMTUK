We're thrilled to announce the launch of the new MMTUK website, a comprehensive hub for Modern Monetary Theory resources, research, and community in the United Kingdom.

## What's New

The new website brings together:

- **Educational Resources**: Accessible explainers and core ideas about how modern money actually works
- **Research Section**: Academic papers, policy briefings, and commentary from leading MMT economists
- **Community Features**: Connect with local groups across the UK and join our growing network

## Our Mission

MMTUK aims to advance public understanding of Modern Monetary Theory and its policy implications for the UK economy. We believe that understanding how money, taxation, and government spending actually work is essential for informed democratic participation.

## Get Involved

Whether you're new to MMT or a seasoned advocate, there's a place for you here. Explore our resources, join your local group, or connect with us on Discord.

Welcome to MMTUK.
