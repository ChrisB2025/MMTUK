**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## MMTUK Policy Research Group Officially Launches as a New Dedicated Modern Monetary Theory Think Tank

- New organisation aims to transform UK economic debate by challenging household budget myths and demonstrating real economic constraints
- Launch event on Wednesday 25 February at Friends Meeting House, London, featuring address by Professor Bill Mitchell

**London, 6th February 2026** — MMTUK Policy Research Group officially launches this month as the UK's first organisation dedicated to providing policy research and analysis grounded in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). The organisation fills a critical gap in UK policy discourse by providing rigorous, evidence-based analysis of how the UK's monetary and fiscal systems actually operate.

MMTUK's mission is to demonstrate that the true limits of the British economy are defined by available labour, skills, and resources, rather than arbitrary financial constraints.

MMTUK works across three core areas:

- **Policy research** on employment, inflation, and UK macroeconomic policy
- **Education and training** for campaigners, journalists, and practitioners
- **Community and policy outreach** connecting economic research to real-world issues including cost of living, housing, health, climate, and employment

## Official Launch Event

MMTUK officially launches with a flagship public event in central London, where Patricia Pino will present her new paper, *A Counter-Inflationary Job Guarantee for the United Kingdom*. Professor Bill Mitchell will then respond and amplify the importance of this policy to the UK economy.

- **Date:** Wednesday 25 February 2026, **Time:** 7:00–9:00pm
- **Venue:** Friends Meeting House, 173–177 Euston Road, London NW1 2BJ
- **Speakers:**
  - **Patricia Pino**, MMTUK co-founder, UCL/IIPP PhD candidate, and co-host of The MMT Podcast
  - **Professor Bill Mitchell**, University of Newcastle, Australia, co-founder of MMT

Professor Mitchell is one of the world's leading authorities on employment policy and Modern Monetary Theory. His address will put the case for a public guarantee of employment in the UK and how MMT reframes the policy options available to government.

**Patricia Pino said:** *"A wider and more informed debate about the UK's economic options is urgently needed. Economic discussion is dominated by inaccurate comparisons with household finances and a narrow fixation on debt and deficits. We want to shift the conversation toward what actually constrains policy: productive capacity, labour availability, price stability, and ecological limits. MMTUK will provide the rigorous analysis needed to inform better policy choices."*
