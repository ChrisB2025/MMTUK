MMTUK is pleased to announce the publication of our comprehensive policy paper on implementing a Job Guarantee in the United Kingdom.

## About the Paper

The Job Guarantee is a central policy proposal within Modern Monetary Theory, offering a permanent, federally-funded program that would provide employment to anyone willing and able to work at a living wage.

Our paper examines:

- **Implementation Framework**: How a Job Guarantee could be structured within the UK's existing institutional arrangements
- **Economic Benefits**: The automatic stabilisation properties that make it superior to current unemployment policy
- **Community Impact**: How locally-administered programs could address unmet social and environmental needs
- **Fiscal Considerations**: Why concerns about "affordability" misunderstand the nature of government spending

## Key Findings

The paper demonstrates that a Job Guarantee would:

1. Eliminate involuntary unemployment while maintaining price stability
2. Provide a wage floor that strengthens worker bargaining power
3. Enable investment in care work, environmental restoration, and community services
4. Reduce the social costs associated with unemployment
