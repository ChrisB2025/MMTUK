We're excited to announce the launch of the MMTUK Local Groups Network, bringing Modern Monetary Theory education and advocacy to communities across the United Kingdom.

## Founding Groups

We're launching with local groups in:

- **London** - Our flagship group in the capital
- **Bristol** - Building an MMT community in the South West
- **Manchester** - Connecting MMTers across the North West
- **Birmingham** - Bringing MMT to the Midlands
- **Oxford** - Academic and community engagement
- **Pennines** - Covering Yorkshire and the Peak District
- **Solent** - Southampton, Portsmouth and the South Coast

## What Local Groups Do

Each local group provides:

- **Regular Meetups**: Both online and in-person gatherings
- **Educational Events**: Study groups, reading circles, and workshops
- **Local Advocacy**: Engaging with local councils, MPs, and community organisations
- **Community Building**: A space to connect with like-minded people in your area

## Join Your Local Group

Visit our Local Groups page to find a group near you. All groups are connected through our Discord server, where you can introduce yourself and get involved.

If there isn't a group in your area yet, we're actively looking for people to help start new chapters. Get in touch to learn more about becoming a local organiser.

Together, we're building a nationwide movement for economic understanding and change.
