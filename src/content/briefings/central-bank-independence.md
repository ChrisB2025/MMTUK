A recent Financial Times column insists that central bank independence must remain sacrosanct. This briefing examines whether the evidence supports such reverence, or whether the era of independent central banks has been one of policy failure.

## The Promise

When the Bank of England was granted operational independence in 1997, it was sold on a simple premise: removing monetary policy from political interference would deliver low, stable inflation and support sustainable growth.

Nearly three decades later, we should ask: has this promise been kept?

## The Record

Consider what independent central banks have delivered:

- **The 2008 financial crisis** - Central banks failed to prevent the worst financial collapse since the 1930s
- **A decade of near-zero growth** - Post-crisis recovery was the slowest on record
- **Persistent inequality** - Asset price inflation benefited the wealthy while wages stagnated
- **The 2021-2023 inflation spike** - Central banks were caught flat-footed by supply-driven inflation

When inflation did arrive, the prescribed medicine—aggressive rate hikes—punished mortgage holders and renters while doing little to address supply-side causes. The Bank of England raised rates 14 consecutive times, yet inflation only fell when energy prices moderated.

## The Theoretical Problem

Interest rate policy is a blunt and often counterproductive tool. Raising rates:

- Increases costs for businesses, potentially raising prices
- Redistributes income to savers (often wealthy) from borrowers
- Crushes investment precisely when productivity growth is needed
- Works primarily by creating unemployment—a cruel and inefficient mechanism

## Democratic Accountability

Monetary policy is economic policy. Decisions about interest rates affect every household, every business, every public service. Why should such consequential choices be insulated from democratic oversight?

The argument for independence—that politicians would create inflation for short-term electoral gain—has not been borne out. Democratic governments in the pre-independence era delivered comparable inflation outcomes, often better ones.

## The Alternative

MMT suggests a different approach:

1. **Set interest rates permanently at zero** - Remove this distortionary policy lever
2. **Use fiscal policy for demand management** - More direct, more effective, more democratically accountable
3. **Use regulation for financial stability** - Central banks can focus on their supervisory role
4. **Target full employment** - Make jobs, not inflation, the primary objective

## Conclusion

Central bank independence has become a shibboleth—defended reflexively rather than on evidence. A democratic society deserves monetary policy that serves the public interest, not an unaccountable institution pursuing a narrow mandate that has repeatedly failed.
