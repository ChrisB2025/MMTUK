The recent article in the Financial Times warning about Britain's "debt crisis" relies heavily on the debt-to-GDP ratio as evidence of fiscal unsustainability. This briefing explains why this metric fundamentally misrepresents the fiscal capacity of a currency-issuing government like the UK.

## The Debt-to-GDP Myth

The debt-to-GDP ratio compares the stock of government debt (accumulated over decades or centuries) to a single year's flow of economic output. This is akin to comparing a household's mortgage to their annual salary—useful perhaps for households, but deeply misleading when applied to currency issuers.

The UK government, as the monopoly issuer of pounds sterling, faces no solvency constraint in its own currency. It can always meet any obligation denominated in pounds. The relevant constraints are real resources—labour, materials, productive capacity—not financial ones.

## What Actually Matters

Instead of fixating on arbitrary ratios, we should ask:

1. **Is there unemployed labour?** If yes, government spending can mobilise these resources without causing inflation.
2. **Is there unused productive capacity?** Idle factories and equipment represent genuine waste.
3. **What is the inflation rate?** This tells us whether the economy is overheating, not debt ratios.

## The Real "Debt"

Government "debt" is better understood as the non-government sector's savings. When the government runs a deficit, it creates financial assets for the private sector. Gilts held by pension funds, for instance, represent safe, interest-bearing savings for UK citizens.

Calling for deficit reduction is equivalent to calling for a reduction in private sector savings—hardly a recipe for prosperity.

## Conclusion

The debt-to-GDP obsession serves to constrain policy options artificially. By understanding that currency-issuing governments operate differently from households, we can focus on what truly matters: full employment, price stability, and genuine prosperity for all.
