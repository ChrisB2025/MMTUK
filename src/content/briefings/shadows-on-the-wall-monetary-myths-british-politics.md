The Treasury tells us there is no money. The Bank of England tells us it operates independently. The OBR tells us the deficit must be closed. They have been projecting these shadows on the wall for so long that most of us, MPs included, have mistaken them for reality.

**Most people have encountered Plato's cave allegory at some point. Prisoners chained since birth, facing a blank wall, watching shadows cast by objects they cannot see. The shadows are all they know, so they take them for reality. When one prisoner escapes and sees the actual world, he returns to tell the others. They think he's mad.**

I was listening to a discussion on Plato's Republic recently when it struck me how well the Cave allegory describes the way politicians talk about government finances. The shadows they describe are familiar to all of us: the government must collect taxes before it can spend; the national debt is a burden future generations must repay; the Bank of England operates as an independent check on fiscal excess. These claims are repeated so often, by so many apparently authoritative voices, that questioning them sounds eccentric. But the institutional mechanics of the UK Exchequer, documented in legislation and central bank publications, tell a different story.

## What the accounting actually shows

When HM Treasury spends, it does so by instructing the Bank of England to credit commercial bank accounts. This is money creation. The legal basis for it predates modern debates about fiscal policy by more than a century: the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 established that expenditure from the Consolidated Fund is charged "on the growing produce" of future revenue. The Bank of England has no discretion over whether to extend this credit. Parliament authorises spending, and the Bank facilitates it. That status was not changed by the Bank of England Act 1998, which granted operational independence over monetary policy.

Taxes, then, do not fund spending in the way that a household's income funds its outgoings. Taxation performs other functions: it creates demand for sterling, frees up real resources in the economy, and redistributes purchasing power. These are substantial purposes. But the claim that government must first collect taxes or borrow before it can spend is an accounting fiction. HM Treasury spends first, by law, and the matching liabilities follow.

The "full funding rule," under which government expenditure is offset by an equivalent amount of tax revenue and gilt issuance, is a policy convention. It is not a legal requirement, and quantitative easing effectively bypassed it on an enormous scale, with the Bank of England buying back hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of the very gilts issued to satisfy the rule. The convention persists not because it reflects operational reality, but because it reinforces a particular story about fiscal discipline.

## The independence fiction

Bank of England independence is real in one narrow sense: the Monetary Policy Committee sets the base interest rate without day-to-day instruction from ministers. In every other meaningful respect, the Bank operates as an arm of the state. Its entire capital stock is held by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of HM Treasury. The Treasury provides indemnities for the Bank's operations, including the hundreds of billions committed under quantitative easing. The Bank is legally obliged to advance credit to the Consolidated Fund. In a financial crisis, it is HM Treasury that underwrites the banking system, not the other way around.

None of this is secret. It is documented in legislation, in memoranda of understanding between the Treasury and the Bank, and in the Bank's own publications. Yet the public narrative of an independent central bank standing guard against fiscal irresponsibility persists because it serves the interests of both institutions: it gives the Bank authority, and it gives the Treasury a convenient excuse for inaction.

## Who casts the shadows?

The institutions responsible for economic forecasting and fiscal analysis in the UK present themselves as politically neutral. The Office for Budget Responsibility produces forecasts based on orthodox macroeconomic models. The Treasury frames public spending in the language of "taxpayers' money." The Bank communicates as though its operations are entirely separable from fiscal policy. Each of these framings embeds assumptions that point in a consistent direction: toward the idea that government spending is inherently constrained, that deficits are inherently risky, and that the primary purpose of economic policy is to maintain the confidence of financial markets.

This is not a party-political bias. Both major parties have largely accepted these framings for decades. It is better described as an institutional orthodoxy: a set of assumptions so deeply embedded in the machinery of economic governance that they are no longer recognised as assumptions at all. When a Chancellor says "there is no magic money tree," they are not lying. They are describing the shadows on the wall as faithfully as they can. They have never been shown anything else.

## The prisoner who returns

Anyone who points to the actual mechanics of the Exchequer, citing legislation and Bank of England publications rather than orthodox economic models, faces a predictable reception. They are labelled "magic money tree" advocates, regardless of whether they are proposing any particular spending programme. The accusation conflates two separate things: the factual description of how the monetary system operates, and the policy question of how much the government ought to spend and on what. You can accept the institutional reality that the UK government is not monetarily constrained in the way a household is, while holding any number of views about what fiscal policy should look like.

The confusion between description and prescription is not accidental. It is the mechanism by which the shadows are maintained. If people understood the mechanics, they would ask different questions. Instead of "how will we pay for it?", they might ask "do we have the real resources, the people, the materials, the capacity?" That is a harder question, and one that cannot be deflected with a reference to the bond markets.

## Why it matters for democracy

Parliament's constitutional function is to control the public purse. If MPs themselves do not understand how public money is created and spent, they cannot perform that function. They become dependent on the Treasury and the Bank of England for interpretation, and those interpretations come pre-loaded with orthodox assumptions that Parliament is not equipped to interrogate.

This is a democratic problem, not a technical one. When unelected officials frame fiscal reality through models that assume constraints which do not operationally exist, and elected representatives lack the knowledge to challenge those framings, policy is being shaped by institutional convention rather than democratic choice. Plato's prisoners at least had the excuse that they were physically chained. Our Parliament has the key, if it would only look for it.
