A recent commentary warns that "bond vigilantes" will punish the UK government if it pursues expansionary fiscal policy. This narrative fundamentally misunderstands how currency-issuing governments interact with financial markets.

## Who Really Sets Interest Rates?

The Bank of England, not bond markets, determines the cost of government borrowing. The central bank sets the overnight rate and can purchase any quantity of gilts if needed. Japan has demonstrated this for decades, maintaining near-zero rates despite a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 250%.

## The Gilt Issuance Choice

Crucially, the UK government does not need to issue gilts at all. Gilt issuance is a policy choice—a form of monetary policy that provides interest-bearing assets to the private sector. The government could simply leave reserves in the banking system instead.

When commentators warn about "bond market discipline," they ignore that the government holds all the cards in this relationship. Investors want safe assets; the government provides them. If yields rose significantly, the Bank of England could simply purchase gilts to maintain its target rate.

## Historical Evidence

The "bond vigilante" narrative has been consistently wrong:

- **Japan**: Decades of deficits, no bond crisis
- **UK 2008-2020**: Massive QE, rates remained low
- **COVID response**: Unprecedented spending, yields fell

Each time, the predicted punishment failed to materialise because the predictions were based on a flawed understanding of monetary operations.

## The Real Risk

The genuine risk is not bond market revolt but insufficient spending during economic downturns. Austerity in the name of bond market appeasement has caused genuine harm—lost output, unemployment, and deteriorating public services.

We should reject the bond vigilante myth and focus on the real economy: do we have the resources to meet our collective needs? If yes, we should deploy them.
