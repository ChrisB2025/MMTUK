A recent article in The Economist argues that Britain must embrace fiscal consolidation to restore market confidence. This analysis fundamentally misunderstands how fiscal multipliers work and why austerity typically fails on its own terms.

## The Multiplier Effect

When the government spends money, it doesn't simply disappear—it becomes someone's income. That person then spends a portion of it, becoming another person's income, and so on. This chain of spending is the multiplier effect.

During recessions, when private spending is depressed, fiscal multipliers are particularly high. The IMF itself has acknowledged that multipliers during downturns can exceed 1.5—meaning every pound of spending cut reduces GDP by £1.50 or more.

## Why Austerity Defeats Itself

Consider the arithmetic: if cutting £10 billion in spending reduces GDP by £15 billion, tax revenues fall substantially. The deficit may actually *increase* despite the spending cuts, while the debt-to-GDP ratio worsens because GDP has shrunk.

This is precisely what occurred during the UK's post-2010 austerity programme. Despite severe cuts to public services, the deficit remained stubbornly high for years, and growth stagnated.

## The Alternative Approach

Rather than cutting spending during downturns, governments should:

1. **Allow automatic stabilisers to work** - Let benefits and lower tax receipts cushion the downturn
2. **Consider targeted fiscal expansion** - Investment in infrastructure, green energy, and public services
3. **Focus on full employment** - A working population generates tax revenue and reduces benefit costs

## The Real Constraint

The genuine constraint on government spending is not financial but real: do we have the workers, materials, and productive capacity? If unemployment exists, the answer is clearly yes—we have idle resources that government spending can mobilise.

"Tightening the belt" when the private sector is already doing so merely compounds the problem. The time to reduce deficits is during booms, not busts.
