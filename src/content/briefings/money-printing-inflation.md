The Daily Telegraph recently warned of an impending "inflation storm" caused by government "money printing." This briefing examines why this analysis fundamentally misunderstands the causes of inflation and the nature of government spending.

## The Quantity Theory Myth

The claim that "money printing causes inflation" derives from the quantity theory of money: MV = PT. The idea is simple—more money means higher prices. But this model has consistently failed to predict inflation accurately.

Consider: central banks created trillions in reserves through quantitative easing from 2009 onwards. Where was the predicted hyperinflation? It never materialised because the theory misunderstands how modern monetary systems work.

## What Actually Causes Inflation

Inflation occurs when spending exceeds the economy's productive capacity. The key factors are:

1. **Supply constraints** - Not enough workers, materials, or equipment
2. **Cost-push factors** - Energy prices, supply chain disruptions
3. **Demand-pull factors** - Spending growing faster than output capacity

The 2021-2023 inflation spike was driven primarily by supply factors: COVID supply chain disruptions, the energy price shock from the Ukraine war, and corporate profit-margin expansion. It was not caused by government deficits.

## The Evidence

Japan has run persistent deficits for three decades. Its debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 250%. Yet it has struggled with *deflation*, not inflation. This single example should give pause to anyone claiming deficits automatically cause inflation.

Similarly, the UK ran enormous deficits during COVID. Inflation remained subdued until external supply shocks hit. When those shocks eased, so did inflation—despite the Bank of England's rate hikes, not because of them.

## Real Resource Constraints

MMT emphasises that the true constraint on government spending is real resources, not money. If there are unemployed workers and idle factories, additional spending can mobilise these without causing inflation. The spending creates output, not just higher prices.

Only when spending continues to grow after full employment is reached do we face genuine inflation risk. At that point, taxation—which removes spending power from the economy—becomes the appropriate tool.

## Conclusion

"Money printing causes inflation" is a slogan, not an analysis. Understanding what actually drives prices—real resource constraints and supply factors—leads to far better policy than reflexive deficit hawkery.
