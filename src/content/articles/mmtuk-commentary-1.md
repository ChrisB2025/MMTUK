#### Introduction to MMT

Modern Monetary Theory offers a new perspective on fiscal policy, emphasizing the role of government spending in driving economic growth. It challenges traditional views on budget deficits and inflation, suggesting that countries with sovereign currencies can never 'run out' of money in the same way individuals can. This understanding reshapes how we think about public finance and economic stability.
