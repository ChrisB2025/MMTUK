summary: "MMT is a description of how monetary systems actually operate, not a political ideology."

MMT describes the operations of currency-issuing governments. This is analogous to describing how an engine works, which does not tell you where to drive.

The core insights of MMT:

* Currency-issuing governments spend by creating money
* Taxation creates demand for currency and can manage inflation
* Government deficits equal non-government surpluses (accounting identity)
* Unemployment is evidence of insufficient spending
* The real constraints are resources, not finance

These are descriptive claims about how the system operates. They are either accurate or inaccurate, regardless of your political views.

Policy conclusions drawn from MMT can vary widely:

* Some MMT economists advocate for a Job Guarantee
* Others focus on public investment in specific sectors
* The framework can inform tax policy design
* It clarifies trade-offs in policy choices

A conservative who understands MMT might advocate for different policies than a progressive who understands MMT. But both would be working from an accurate understanding of monetary operations rather than the false constraints of the household analogy.

Many mainstream economists privately acknowledge that MMT's description of monetary operations is correct while disagreeing about policy implications. The operational description is not controversial among those who study central banking closely.
