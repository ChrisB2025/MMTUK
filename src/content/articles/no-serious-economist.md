The claim that MMT is fringe or unserious misrepresents its intellectual foundations and growing influence.

### Academic Foundations

MMT synthesises work from:

* John Maynard Keynes (monetary theory of production)
* Hyman Minsky (financial instability, employer of last resort)
* Abba Lerner (functional finance)
* Wynne Godley (sectoral balances)
* Chartalism and state theory of money

### Institutional Validation

Central bankers have repeatedly confirmed MMT's operational descriptions:

* Bank of England (2014): "Money creation in the modern economy" confirms that banks create money through lending, not from deposits
* Former Fed officials have acknowledged the accuracy of MMT's description of Treasury/Fed operations

### Growing Influence

* US Congressional testimony by Stephanie Kelton
* Policy discussions in multiple countries
* Academic programmes at University of Missouri-Kansas City, Levy Economics Institute, and University of Adelaide
* Increasing engagement from mainstream economists

Disagreement exists about policy implications, which is normal in economics. The operational description of how currency-issuing governments spend and how monetary systems function is increasingly accepted even by critics.
