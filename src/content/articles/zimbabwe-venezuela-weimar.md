Hyperinflation is rare and occurs under specific conditions that do not apply to developed economies with stable institutions.

### Weimar Germany (1921-1923)

The Weimar hyperinflation followed military defeat, territorial losses, massive war reparations denominated in foreign currency, and French occupation of the industrial Ruhr region. Germany had lost productive capacity and faced obligations it could not meet in its own currency.

### Zimbabwe (2007-2009)

Zimbabwe's hyperinflation followed the collapse of agricultural production after land reform, international sanctions, loss of export earnings, and political instability. The productive economy had been destroyed before the monetary crisis.

### Venezuela (2016-present)

Venezuela's crisis stems from oil price collapse, economic mismanagement, sanctions, loss of productive capacity, and political turmoil. The economy was already in freefall before inflation accelerated.

The common thread is not government spending but destruction of productive capacity combined with obligations in foreign currency or loss of monetary sovereignty.

The UK has:

* Stable political institutions
* Diverse productive economy
* Sovereign currency with floating exchange rate
* Debts denominated in its own currency
* Functional central bank

None of the preconditions for hyperinflation apply.
