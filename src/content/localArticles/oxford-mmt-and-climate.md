The climate crisis demands urgent and substantial investment. Yet too often, well-intentioned climate policies are constrained by the question: "But how will we pay for it?"

## Reframing the Question

MMT helps us understand that for a currency-issuing government, the relevant question is not financial - it's about real resources. Do we have the workers, materials, and productive capacity to undertake the green transition?

## The Job Guarantee and Green Jobs

One key MMT policy proposal is the Job Guarantee - a programme offering employment to anyone willing and able to work at a living wage. This could be specifically oriented toward green infrastructure projects:

- Tree planting and ecosystem restoration
- Retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency
- Community renewable energy projects
- Sustainable agriculture support

## Addressing Inflation Concerns

Critics often worry about inflation from increased government spending. MMT economists emphasise that:

1. The green transition often involves redirecting resources from carbon-intensive to sustainable sectors
2. Investment in renewable energy can reduce long-term energy costs
3. The Job Guarantee inherently acts as a price anchor

## Local Action

In Oxford, we're exploring how these ideas can inform local climate initiatives. Join our discussions to learn more about the intersection of monetary understanding and environmental action.
