London faces significant challenges in public service provision - from housing to transport to healthcare. The common refrain is always about lack of funding. But what if we're asking the wrong questions?

## The Conventional View

The conventional narrative suggests that:
- Government spending is limited by tax revenue and borrowing
- We must "balance the books" like a household
- Austerity is necessary when deficits are "too high"

## The MMT Perspective

MMT reveals a different picture:

### Spending Comes First

The UK government, as issuer of the pound, doesn't need to "find money" before it can spend. When the government spends, it credits bank accounts - creating new money. When it taxes, it debits accounts - removing money from circulation.

### The Purpose of Bonds

Government bonds don't "fund" spending. Instead, they provide a safe interest-bearing asset and help the Bank of England manage interest rates.

### Real Constraints Matter

The true limits are:
- Available workers with appropriate skills
- Physical resources and materials
- Productive capacity of the economy

## What This Means for London

Understanding these mechanics opens up space for:
- Serious investment in social housing
- Proper funding for the NHS and social care
- Sustainable transport infrastructure
- Green retrofitting of public buildings

The question becomes: what kind of London do we want, and do we have the real resources to build it?

Join MMTUK London to explore these ideas and discuss their implications for our city.
